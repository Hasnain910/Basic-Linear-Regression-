# Basic-Linear-Regression-
## Linear regression example for rate of change estimation

This Python script demonstrates how to use linear regression to estimate the rate of change (slope) between two variables: time and value. 

The code utilizes numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib for data visualization, and sklearn for applying linear regression.


### Features:

- Fits a linear model to time-series data
- Visualizes the data and the fitted regression line
- Calculates and displays the estimated rate of change (slope)

 
### Libraries used:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn


### Usage:

Modify the time and values arrays to apply the code to your own dataset.
The script will output the estimated rate of change and plot the data with the regression line.
